This gems aims to provide a modern version of Struct.
While Struct is a nice and easy way to create a light-weight
value object, it has some drawbacks

* You need to remember the order of arguments
* The object is mutable by default

This gem aims to avoid these drawbacks, while providing the
ease of use of Struct.

## Usage

If you want to create a simple object, just declare it like
you would declare a Struct:

```ruby
Rectangle = StrictStruct.new(:x, :y) do
  def area
    x * y
  end
end
```

This would conceptually create something like the following object:

```ruby
class Rectange
  attr_reader :x, :y

  def initialize(x:, y:)
    @x = x
    @y = y
  end

  def to_h
    to_hash
  end

  def to_hash
    {
      x: x,
      y: y
    }
  end

  def area
    x * y
  end
end
```

Since this is meant to create immutable objects, the values aren't actually assigned to instance variables but saved internally in a hash.

### Changing behavior

You can also choose to override behavior. You can just use super in the initialization block like you are used to with normal classes:

```ruby
Rectangle = StrictStruct.new(:x, :y) do
  def area
    x * y
  end

  def to_hash
    super.merge({area: area})
  end
end
```

## Installation
